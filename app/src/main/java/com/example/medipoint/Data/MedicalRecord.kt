    // === Original Check-In (if applicable and from your app) ===
    // If this record was directly tied to an appointment with a check-in through your app,
    // you might want to embed or link the CheckInRecord.
    // However, if CheckInRecord is ONLY for appointments made via your app,
    // and this MedicalRecord could be from an external source, embedding it directly
    // might not always make sense.
    // Consider if `checkInRecord` from your old `MedicalRecordDetails` should be here
    // or if the link via `appointmentId` (which might have its own check-in) is sufficient.
    // For now, I'll keep it as it was in your previous structure:
    val checkInRecord: CheckInRecord? = null // From your existing CheckInRecord data class
    // Make this nullable, as external records won't have it.
)

// You would still have your PrescribedMedication.kt and CheckInRecord.kt as separate data classes:
// data class PrescribedMedication(val name: String = "", val dosage: String = "", val frequency: String = "")
// data class CheckInRecord(val id: String = "", /* ... other fields ... */)
